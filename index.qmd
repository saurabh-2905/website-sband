<!-- ## Bio  -->

## Hi, Iâ€™m Saurabh ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a PhD researcher at the Department of Sustainable Communication Networks (<a href="https://www.uni-bremen.de/comnets" target="_blank">ComNets</a>), University of Bremen, Germany, where I work on making **IoT devices more reliable and intelligent**. My research focuses on enabling microcontroller-based devices to detect and diagnose malfunctions during runtime, significantly reducing the time and effort needed for debugging in the field.  

I combine microcontrollers with lightweight machine learning models to bring advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) capabilities to the edge. My broader interests include **low-power IoT applications, edge computing, and efficient ML on constrained devices**.  

Beyond Earth, I was part of the [Humans on Mars Initiative](https://www.uni-bremen.de/humans-on-mars-initiative), where we explore how to build reliable wireless sensor networks for extraterrestrial habitatsâ€”a challenge that pushes the boundaries of what robust IoT can achieve.  

During my PhD journey, Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to mentor masterâ€™s students on their projects and thesesâ€”an equally rewarding experience that taught me as much as I taught them.  

On this site youâ€™ll find my **publications, CV, and updates** on topics Iâ€™m currently exploring.  

<!-- Iâ€™m a Research Assistant at department of Sustainable Communication Networks (ComNets), at Univesity of Bremen, Germany, My work focuses on making **microcontroller-based IoT devices more reliable and power-efficient**. Much of my recent work focuses on bringing **machine learning for anomaly detection and fault diagnosis (FDD)** onto resource-constrained **wireless sensor nodes**, while carefully measuring the **overhead in CPU, memory, and energy use** that these techniques introduce.  

In prior projects, Iâ€™ve explored a range of directions: developing **runtime anomaly detection (VarLogger)** for sensor nodes, studying the **reliability of monitoring systems for extraterrestrial habitats**, and experimenting with **low-power wireless protocols such as LoRa**. I enjoy combining **measurement-driven evaluation** with **practical embedded prototyping** (often in MicroPython), to keep research both rigorous and implementable.  

By training Iâ€™m an embedded systems engineer; professionally, Iâ€™ve worked across **sensor systems, wireless networking, anomaly detection, and machine learning applications**.
