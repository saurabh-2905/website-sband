	abstract = {Among the various required resources for this civilization, the habitat is one of the crucial resources to live on Mars. Such an extraterrestrial habitat is designed to provide a safe place to live during the initial missions. It is equipped with monitoring and life support systems to ensure the astronauts' safety. In this work, we present a robust monitoring system with a use case for extraterrestrial habitats. Similar to a typical monitoring system, it consists of sensor nodes and a gateway connected through a wireless communication channel. In our system, we introduce robustness to various failures that can occur after deployment, namely, board, sensor and gateway failure, in the form of redundancy. For each failure, the problem is tackled differently. For the first two types, we use additional hardware as backup, while for the last type, we use neighbouring devices as backups. The backup devices function as replacements for the failed component, which helps the system to collect the data which would otherwise be lost. We evaluate how much the performance of the system improves by using backup devices. We use a Continuous-Time Markov chain for the theoretical evaluation and an experimental setup that includes the hardware prototype for the empirical evaluation. We also analyze the effect of a simple medium access mechanism on the system's performance in the presence of heavy noise on the channel. Based on our requirements, we use a simple custom medium access control (MAC) algorithm called Slotted-ALOHA with Random Back-off (SARB) to make communication reliable. We demonstrate that around \$30-34{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the packets are recovered, with the use of backup devices (redundancy), which would otherwise be lost in case of failures. We also demonstrate that the system's performance improves by \$3.8-13.2{\textbackslash}\%\$ with the use of a simple medium access technique (SARB).},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor networks, post-deployment is-sues persist despite extensive testing, primarily due to unpredictable environmental factors and limited debugging tools for resource-constrained end nodes. This challenge is particularly pronounced in remote applications such as extraterrestrial habitats. To address this, we propose a runtime anomaly detection and diagnosis method for resource-constrained sensor nodes. A key advantage of our approach is its ability to learn expected behavior from historical data, eliminating the need for explicit behavior modeling, unlike other runtime fault detection methods. Our method comprises three main components: logging, detection, and diagnosis. We log event traces on the sensor nodes, enabling activity tracking down to the variable level. For anomaly detection, we explore various methods, including state transition, execution interval analysis, and clustering. Subsequently, diagnosis is performed using the logged event traces.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a robust and dependable monitoring system designed for space missions where reliability is critical. Theoretically, we use the Markov chain model to evaluate the availability of the system, considering multiple instances of backup devices. The results indicate a substantial improvement in system availability with the inclusion of backup devices. The findings highlight the significance of redundancy in enhancing system dependability while considering practical constraints. Based on this insight, we design an algorithm to deploy backup devices in the system that would improve the system's availability without putting strain on the resources (e.g., channel congestion). It uses backup devices at the sensor node and gateway levels. The algorithm involves backup devices that actively monitor and take over in case of failures, enhancing the system's ability to recover lost or faulty data. We test the system in three failure scenarios: hard failures, sensor failures, and gateway failures. We perform the experiments on our hardware prototypes. Experimental results demonstrate that using backup devices significantly improves the Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) in failure scenarios. We observed an improvement of 30 - 34\% in packet reception for different failure scenarios.},
