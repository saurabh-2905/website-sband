    "text": "I’m a PhD researcher at the Department of Sustainable Communication Networks (ComNets), University of Bremen, Germany, where I work on making IoT devices more reliable and intelligent. My research focuses on enabling microcontroller-based devices to detect and diagnose malfunctions during runtime, significantly reducing the time and effort needed for debugging in the field.\nI combine microcontrollers with lightweight machine learning models to bring advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) capabilities to the edge. My broader interests include low-power IoT applications, edge computing, and efficient ML on constrained devices.\nBeyond Earth, I was part of the Humans on Mars Initiative, where we explore how to build reliable wireless sensor networks for extraterrestrial habitats—a challenge that pushes the boundaries of what robust IoT can achieve.\nDuring my PhD journey, I’ve also had the opportunity to mentor master’s students on their projects and theses—an equally rewarding experience that taught me as much as I taught them.\nOn this site you’ll find my publications, CV, and updates on topics I’m currently exploring."
